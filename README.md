# Sorting Visualizer
 The project demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action by visually representing the process of sorting a set of elements. The project typically involves creating an interactive user interface where users can input a list of numbers or other data, choose a sorting algorithm to apply, and observe how the algorithm rearranges the elements to put them in order.
